[![wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/wiki-guide-success)](https://github.com/Messyproduct/Smash-Ultimate-Expression-Maker/wiki)

A Blender add-on for quickly generating expression meshes for Smash Ultimate using shape keys

Designed for use with Blender 3.0, may be compatible with future releases

## Installation
1. Click releases, navigate to the latest version, download the top file (not the source code), Don't unzip the file.
2. Install the .ZIP in Blender under `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install`
3. Make sure the addon is enabled by searching for "Expression".
4. After installing the plugin in blender, in the 3D Viewport pull up the Sidebar (Hotkey is 'N'), and look for 'Ultimate' tab in the Sidebar

## Uninstalling / Updating
Go to the `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install` page and click the remove button. Once removed you can install the update

## Features
* Split Shape keys into meshes defined by inputted expression vertex groups (No normal seams)
  * Includes batch functionality for all at once generation (may be resource intensive on lower end computers)
* Smooth Shape Keys into the base face model to minimize seams. (May need to be edited manually for best results)
* Delete remaining shape keys from created meshes

## Planned Features
Currently nothing is planned for this tool. It is working exactly as I had pictured it for my own personal use, however if you have an idea of a feature suggestion feel free to make a GitHub issue of your idea. I'd love to hear them.

## Issues?
Please before making an issue read the wiki documentation. If you feel you are following the instructions and are still getting an error message please make a GitHub issue and I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.

If you get an error with this preface: ```Something went wrong, it may be a bug or user error.``` please include the full error message in the GitHub Issues

## Special Thanks
SSBUCarlos for helping me problem solve during development and letting my lift some of these instructions
